Game Rules:

- random secret word selected and displays a series of underscores representing each letter on the screen.
- Other players attempt to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time.
- A set number of incorrect guesses may be allowed before the game ends.
- Players must enter their guesses through an online interface, such as typing a letter into a box or selecting a letter from a virtual keyboard.
- If a guessed letter is in the word, all instances of that letter are revealed in the blanks.
- If a guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman's figure is drawn on the screen.
- The game ends when either the word is correctly guessed or the hangman's figure is completed.

Have Fun!
